# Predicting Average Global  Sea Level Changes through 2050 


I have analysed a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. I have used the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

The following tasks are included:

•	Used Pandas to import the data from sea-level.csv taken from https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level

•	Used matplotlib to create a scatter plot using the "Year" column as the x-axis and the "CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level" column as the y-axis.

•	Used the linregress function from scipy.stats to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit. Plotted the line of best fit over the top of the plot. Made the line go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050.

•	Plotted a new line of best fit just using the data from year 2000 through the most recent year in the dataset. Made the line also go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050 if the rate of rise continues as it has since the year 2000.

•	The x label is  "Year", the y label is "Sea Level (inches)", and the title is  "Rise in Sea Level".
